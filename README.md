# SpaceshipTitanic

## Data Science
### Project 4 - Spaceship Titanic Competition
#### Project Goal
Compete in Kaggle's Spaceship Titanic Competition to see how well you can predict survivors! Use machine learning tools to move up the leaderboard.

### Requirements
You will work in a local Jupyter notebook(s) and upload submissions to Kaggle for auto-scoring.
You may make as many submissions to Kaggle as the competition allows (10 per day)
You should show (almost) all your work in the notebook. For instance, if you inspect the data to find a mean, keep that code in the Notebook, etc.
Your notebook should walk the user through your process. It doesn't need to explain what a DataFrame is, but it should use plenty of markdown so that you can present it to a semi-technical audience!
You should keep all your submission files. (One nice thing to do is to append a timestamp into the filename.)
You should use a RandomForest model with different parameters to determine which will work best.
You should do a proper analysis of the data to determine your approach to the problem.
You should determine which columns should be features, which values should be imputed, and how.
You should use categorical encoding techniques where beneficial.
Feel free to create multiple notebooks for different approaches if it keeps things clear.
You should try XGBoost
You should do one simple Notebook without Pipelines, and then try Pipelines.

### Datasets
The data is available at the Kaggle competition page: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic/data 

### Advice
Although feature engineering is the most time consuming part, try to make a submission early and refine from there.
Do not look through other people's code. 

### Grading
As with all our projects, you will be graded according to a rubric that we will review before you begin.

### Timeline
You will have approximately 1 week to work on your project, plus time outside of class (which you should plan on using!)

### Submit
You will push clean runs of your Notebooks to your GitHub repository and then let me know they're there. Any data files necessary to run the Notebook should also be in that directory.

It is helpful to add submission scores at the end of your notebook to keep track of which approach worked best.
